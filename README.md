Overview

This project focuses on risk analytics in banking by using customer data to reduce the chances of financial loss when lending. It includes an interactive dashboard that analyzes client profiles and banking relationships to help decide if a loan applicant is likely to repay, enabling smarter, data-driven decisions.

Key Features

1. Data integration from multiple linked tables containing client and bank details
2. Data cleaning and exploration using Python and Jupyter Notebook to ensure quality and uncover insights
3. SQL queries for data manipulation and extraction from databases
4. Visualizations to identify risk levels and likelihood of repayment
5. Dashboard templates designed with Canva for a consistent and visually appealing interface
6. What It Does The dashboard analyzes applicant data to predict their repayment probability, enabling the bank to approve or decline loans based on risk assessment. It consolidates various data sources and provides visual insights to support decision-making.

Visualizations of the Dashboard

1. The dashboard features four pages: Home, Loan Analysis, Risk Assessment, and Summary, providing a comprehensive overview of risk factors.
2. It integrates multiple linked datasets containing bank details and client information, enabling in-depth analysis.
3. Visualizations include graphs for credit card amounts, check-in account balances, and loan amounts, helping to identify risk patterns.
4. Specific key values identified include credit card utilization, checking account amounts, and loan sizes, which are represented through various charts.
5. The dashboard allows users to analyze applicant profiles to determine the likelihood of loan repayment, aiding in decision-making.

Process

1. Data Collection: Aggregated multi-source data including client, bank, and transaction details.
2. Data Cleaning: Used Python scripts within Jupyter Notebook to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize data.
3. Data Exploration: Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and significant features influencing risk.
4. Data Manipulation: Employed SQL queries to extract relevant subsets for analysis.
5. Visualization: Developed dashboards in Power BI to depict risk indicators clearly.
6. Presentation: Created visual templates with Canva for uniformity and professional appearance.
